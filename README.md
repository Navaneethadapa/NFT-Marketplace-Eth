I used Hardhat Taskrunner because it's a flexible and extensible task runner that helps you manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps.

Try Running these commands :

---
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
