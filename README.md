This project demonstrates a use of Hardhat taskrunner as It's a flexible and extensible task runner that helps you manage and automate the recurring tasks inherent to developing smart contracts and dApps.. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running these Commands :

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
